49.095,-117.71,<h5>Trail:</h5>,<h4>Cominco</h4>,"With nuclear reactors relying on the supply of what is known as heavy water, an enriched water mixture that mostly consists of deuterium oxide, the production of heavy water was vital to the success of nuclear reactors. Cominco, an American owned company located in Trail, British Columbia, produced and supplied heavy water to Montréal Laboratory, as well as many other nuclear research facilities, such as the Chicago Pile 3, the world's first heavy water nuclear reactor.",<a href="sites/cominco.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
65.186667,-123.421667,<h5>Deline:</h5>,<h4>Village of Widows</h4>,"The increasing need for uranium to supply nuclear research facilities lead scientists to the first nation village of Délįne, in the Northwest Territories. The men of the village would transport bags of uranium from the mines to Fort McMurray, where the uranium would be transported to the Eldorado refinery in Port Hope. Délįne became known as the Village of Widows as many of the men began to die of cancer while handling uranium.",<a href="sites/deline.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
