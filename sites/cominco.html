		 <h4>Historical Context</h4>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The company Cominco, was an American company which produced heavy water in Trail British Columbia during the Second World War. Heavy water is specialized water which contains large amounts of heavy hydrogen. Heavy water is extremly hard to produce, and is very rare. Heavy water is only produced in a few areas, mostly in Canada, Norway, the United States, Russia, Argentina, and Japan. The company started the production of heavy water in 1943 in order to support the American Manhattan project. Cominco was a key component in the P-9 project which sought to provide the American and Allies with nuclear weapons before Nazi Germany manufactured one. Nazi Germany gained its heavy water from Norway, whereas the Allies gained their heavy water from Canada, the United States, and Russia. The heavy water prduced at the plant was shipped down to the United States and only produced heavy water until 1956. The P-9 Project was extremly crucial to the war effort, and particually to Canadian aid in the development of nuclear technology. </p>

	 <h4>Lasting Impact</h4>
	     <hr>
	     <p> The lasting impact of the Cominco facility in Trail, British Columbia, is that the location never actually produced the heavy water needed for the atomic bombs for Japan, and that the facility was only kept open as a reserve supply for American nuclear development. The heavy water facility finaly closed down in 2008, but the facility remains open for smelting purposes.  </p>
