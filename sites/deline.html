	    <h3>The Village of Widows</h3>
	     	 <br>
	     	 <h4>Historical Context</h4>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Deline, a small First Nations village found in Northwest Territories, and while they had little to do with nuclear research or development, their involvement in Canada's nuclear history should not be ignored. The town was an outpost for the transport of uranium ore from the <a href="https://maggiesherwin.github.io/daea/sites/eldorado-mines.html">Eldorado Mines in Port Radium</a> to the <a href="https://maggiesherwin.github.io/daea/sites/eldorado-refinery.html">Eldorado Refinery in Port Hope</a>. The First Nations men of Deline were hired to carry uranium from the mines to the boats on Great Bear Lake, and from there to Fort McMurray, where the Ore would be shipped to Port Hope. The bags of ore would be handled several times throughout their trip, and the workers would often sleep on or near them.</p>		
		<br>
		 <h4>The Village of Widows</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>After having handled bags of uranium throughout long journeys, many of the First Nations men of Deline began to die of an unknown disease. Having never been exposed to cancer before, the people of Deline did not know what was causing so many deaths. The village became known as the "Village of Widows" due to the high amount of men that died of cancer as a result of transporting the uranium ore. The result was that many children of Deline grew up without fathers, or even grandfathers.</p>
         <br>

         <h4>Wartime Nuclear Involvement</h4>
         <hr>
         <p>As stated above, Deline's wartime nuclear involvement was limited to the transportation of uranium ore from Port Radium to Port Hope. Unfortunately, their limited nuclear involvement has had long-lasting consequences. The first nations people of the Village of Widows continue to feel the effects of the radiation poisoning, with many people left without fathers or grandfathers. The image to the left shows a man standing next to a stack of bags filled with uranium ore. The effects of uranium was unknown at this point, and exposure to the bags of uranium was not a concern. As a result, the uranium was not handled safely, and many men of Deline died of cancer several years later.</p>
         <br>
	 <h4>Lasting Impact</h4>
	 <hr>
	 <p>The effects of these deaths and the possible lingering dangers of radiation for the people of Deline will likely never be truely understood. According to <a href="https://assembly.nu.ca/library/Edocs/2005/001195-e.pdf">this</a> study condicted by the Canada-DeÃÅline Uranium Table, the cancer and deaths of these men cannot be blamed directly on their handling of uranium. There is also a phychological impact on the people of Deline, specifically anxiety over being scared of uranium exposure. Anxiety that has increased due to a lack of information being given by those that caused this issue. The people of Deline do not know how much uranium is in the lake that they fish, or the ground that they live on. Because of this, they can no longer trust the land that they have lived on for generations. There is also the issue of losing traditions that comes with a large amount of deaths in a small community. With less teachers, traditions become difficult to pass on. The deaths of these men have had lasting impacts on the community of Deline, and without any true reparations for them, it will be difficult to recover.
