         	<h4>Historical Context</h4> 
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>When Port Radium Mines originally opened on Bear Lake in 1932, Radium was the most expensive material in the world, costing upwards of $125,000 per gram. By 1940, the lethal effects of radium became known, and the industry collapsed, leading to the closure of the radium mines in Port Radium. Only two short years later, the Canadian government expropriated the mines, creating "Eldorado Nuclear" in 1942. The goal of the reopened mines was to supply uranium for the American nuclear weapon research project. The image on the left shows a miner pushing a cart bearing uranium ore through the Eldorado Mines, sometime in the 1930s.</p>
		     <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->

	     <h4>Port Radium</h4>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     	       <p>In the 30s, during the height of the radium industry, a town of about 200+ grew around Cameron Bay, which was remaned Port Radium as a nod to it's main export. This town included a post office, RCMP station, and many other necessary businesses. The image to the left shows the many factories among the small mining community. The Eldorado mine and its community later adopted the name "Port Radium" and to this day the entire area including the mine and Cameron Bay is known by the same name.</p>

		 <h4>Wartime Nuclear Activity</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>After being expropriated by the Canadian Government in 1942, the Eldorado Mines produced and sold uranium salts to the United States for use in their nuclear weapons research. As the uranium was being produced to develop the world's first atomic bombs, the miners and families of those who worked at the mines were sworn to secrecy, and the productions of uranium remained a secret throughout the war. Eldorado Nuclear was one of three uranium mines under Allied control during the Second World War, and as such, Port Radium played a very critical role in the creation of the Atomic Bomb.</p>

	     <h4>Lasting Impact</h4>
	     <hr>
	     <p>After the war, mining in the Eldorado mines continued. During this time, radium, uranium, silver, and copper were all mined depending on demand. In 1964, the mining company Echo Bay Mines becan to use Eldorado as a silver mine. This lasted until 1982 when the mine was officially closed. The image to the right shoes the Eldorado mine as it exists today, having been burned down in 1982. The impact of this mine is still being felt today, with concerns about possible radiation in Bear lake.  After closure, radioactive wastes were found to be present in soils and surface water. Port Radium was issued remediation by the Canadian Government in order to make the site safer for animals, people, and the environment. </p>
