		 <h4>Historical Context</h4>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Originally organized in 1927 as Eldorado Gold Mines Limited, Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited found success beyond gold located in Manitoba. Although, these mines were later discovered to be having deposits of radioactive material.The Eldorado Refinery extracted radium from uranium ore, dumping the uranium waste throughout Port Hope or using it as fill material. The refinery stayed open for about eight years, using the small town as a dump site for tonnes of uranium waste. They built a state-of-the-art refinery in Port Hope, Ontario in 1933. Radium production took place between 1933 and 1940 when World War II closed European markets for radium material. The other byproduct of the company was silver, copper, and uranium salts. Uranium was useless until scientists realized the enormous energy potential of the uranium atom. The company reopened the mine at Port Radium in 1942 to supply the United States military with uranium products. </p>
	 <p>Eldorado Refinery was a state-of-the-art refinery originally built in 1932 in Port Hope, Ontario. The Eldorado Refinery extracted radium from uranium ore, dumping the uranium waste throughout Port Hope or using it as fill material. The refinery stayed open for about eight years, using the small town as a dump site for tonnes of uranium waste.</p>
         <p>The newspaper article on the right was found in a 1933 "Port Hope Weekly Guide" newspaper. The article informs the people of Port Hope that work at Eldorado would continue and that Eldorado would likely expand its workload within the next year.</p>
         <p>The Eldorado Refinery in Port Hope was replaced by Cameco, a Uranium conversion plant, in 1988. Port Hope's uranium conversion facility is one of four Uranium conversion plants in the Western World.</p>

		 <h4>Port Hope Impacts</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Port Hope is a small residential town with a population of roughly 16,000 located in Southern Ontario. Due to Port Hope's history of participation in Nuclear Research, particularly in refining of radioactive materials, the small town has the highest amount of low-level radioactive waste in Canada. Because of this, many in Port Hope question why the small town continues to have vested interest through their investment in Cameco's uranium conversion facility.</p>
		 <p>The image to the left shows the once beautiful Port Hope harbour, with the now lost West Beach next to the Eldorado Nuclear Facility. The caption of the photo reads "The West Beach and the baseball diamond were popular spots for many years, for young and old. But no longer. Cameco now occupies almost the entire area, effectively cutting the town off from the lake. Streets that once ran on this side of the viaducts, and the houses that were built on them, have disappeared. The ball diamond and the Pavilion are long gone, the beach has been left a wasteland where people go to walk their dogs. The former West Beach is no more, and the tiny East Beach is there to remind us of the magnitude of our loss." The loss of West Beach is only a small fraction of what has been lost to Port Hope's Nuclear Facility.</p>
         	 <p>The Government of Canada ordered Eldorado to refine uranium by 1942. This was in demand at the time by the United States for the Manhattan Project (also known as: the building of nuclear weapons). The primary role of Port Hope was to refine uranium ore and then ship it to the U.S. This increase in demand led to the federal government taking over Eldorado and making it theirs, a Crown corporation. Up until the 1960’s Eldorado continued to feed uranium to the U.S. The U.S suddenly put a stop to their demand for uranium. This led to Eldorado to turn to new markets, nuclear energy being a promising industry. The first nuclear reactors were set up in Canada by the end of the 1960’s. With CANDU reactors using unique combinations of fuel, the Port Hope Coversion Facility became a leading refinery in its industry. The nuclear energy industry blossomed in Ontario in the 1970’s. That same decade, concerns over radioactive waste and how it should be stored starting cropping up all around the Port Hope region.</p>

	 <br>
         <h4>A Lasting Impact</h4>
	 <p>In the midst of WWII, Canada joined the U.S and the UK in their efforts to make the nuclear bomb. In 1939 the fission method of uranium was discovered which used the energy within the atom. The company reopened the mine at Port Radium in 1942 to supply the United States military with uranium products. By the end of 1942, the UK and Canada had established the Montreal Laboratory to create nuclear weapons. The Canadian Government took over the company by purchasing share control in 1943, and in early 1944 the name was changed to Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited. Scientists from both nations and from France collaborated to design the ZEEP (zero energy experimental pile) reactor. The ZEEP was kept in Chalk River, Ontario where a small prototype was created to prove that natural uranium and heavy water could be used to make nuclear fission. </p>
	 <p>After having been closed in 1940, the Eldorado Refinery, along with the Eldorado Mines in Port Radium, were expropriated by the Canadian Government in 1942, renaming the facilities "Eldorado Nuclear". Eldorado Nuclear began supplying the United States with Uranium as part of the wartime effort to develop the first atomic bombs. This effort became known as the Manhattan Project.</p>
         <p>After several years of dumping uranium waste throughout Port Hope, the uses for uranium in nuclear weapons became better understood. In an effort to create the first nuclear weapon, the uranium waste that was dumped throughout Port Hope was recovered and sent to the United States in their effort to develop the first atomic bombs. The irony of this is that Port Hope's first radioactive waste cleanup supplied the uranium that would be used to develop the first atomic bomb, killing more than 140,000 people.</p>
