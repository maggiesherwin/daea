		 <h4>History of Elliot Lake</h4>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Over the past sixty years, Elliot Lake has had two nicknames, unofficial titles. “Jewel in the Wilderness” being the first and the second “The Uranium Capital of The World”. In the 1950s, the U.S. push for uranium production prompted exploitation of local uranium deposits. Immediately, the town began to grow where there was nothing to be grown at one point. For over 40 years, Elliot Lake was a significant producer of uranium. All through the period of exploitation, and especially after, Elliot Lake promoted itself as a beautiful destination for nature-lovers and outdoor adventurers. Today, the town continues to reconcile its two legacies as a paradoxically thoroughly modern wilderness, trying to become a destination for ecotourism while clinging to its nuclear role.</p>
	     <p>The Uranium Mines of Elliot Lake were opened in the early 1950's in a post-war effort to continue to supply the United States of America with uranium for nuclear weapons development. This lasted for a few years before the United States declared it would no longer purchase uranium from Canada after 1962.  Denison Mines, seen on the left, was the largest of the mines operated in this area.</p>

		 <h4>Elliot Lake Impacts</h4>
		 <hr>
	     	 <p>Mines were producing 74% of Canada’s total refined uranium, or yellowcake by 1959. This process accumulated millions of tons of waste during the process of milling, of which 99.8% of the ore became waste. The waste eventually was abandoned to only pollute to surrounding localities, which were unregulated for decades. It raised the water’s acidity levels and released harmful radioactive decay. This pollution affected not only the people who inhabited the newfound town of Elliot Lake, but also those who had inhabited the land for over five hundred years: the Serpent River First Nation, or Anishinaabe.</p>
		 <p>The waste produced from the Uranium Mines was dumped into ten of the surrounding lakes, killing them all, as well as 90km of the Serpent River. The radioactive waste was not only killing the lakes and rivers, but was also effecting the people, animals, and environment in the Elliot Lake region, as they all became exposed to increased levels of radiation.The image to the right is of uranium "tailings" or waste. </p>

         <h4>Wartime Nuclear Involvement</h4>
         <hr>
         <br>
	     <p>Nine mining companies were in operation and 25,000 people lived in Elliot Lake. During this year, the U.S announced that they will no longer be doing trade with Canada for uranium after 1962.The population of Elliot Lake dropped to below 7000 by 1966. The only mines still in operation were the Denison Mines and Rio Algom. Federal plans were set in place for the CANDU Reactors and Ontario Hydro’s interest played a role i its impact to the community.  This led them to believe the population would expand to 30,000 people. Unfortunately for the Elliot Lake community, by the 1990s, empty mines and low prices caused a loss of over 4000 jobs.</p>
	     <p>This announcement of the mine closure shook the community’s morale and the economy of Elliot Lake. Luckily for Elliot Lake’s strong leadership initiatives and the Elliot Laker’s instinct for survival the community grew again.  This job loss brought new industries to Elliot Lake. All the abandoned units were fabricated to become senior homes with the beginning of the Retirement Living Program. This became a highly successful industry attracting thousands of retirees. This led to the start of the cottaging industry.
	     <p>Although the Uranium Mines in Elliot Lake were opened after the end of World War II, the mines supplied the United States with uranium to continue their nuclear weapons research. The majority of the world's uranium came from the Elliot Lake Uranium Mines, from Cold War nuclear arms, to nuclear energy research.</p>
